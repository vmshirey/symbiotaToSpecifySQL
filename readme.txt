These files are used to create temporary tables that mimic the tables found in Specify as a part of a normalization routine
to move data from the omoccurrences table in Symbiota to a Specify instance. In order to successfully run these files, please
run them in sequential order from sts_1.0 through sts_1.x where x is the highest number in the series of files.
